Actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent an intention to change the state. They contain a type field that describes the type of action being performed.
Actions are typically created using action creator functions, which are functions that return action objects.

Reducers are pure functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions.
A reducer takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state based on that action.
Reducers should never mutate the state directly. Instead, they produce new state objects with the updated values.


The store holds the complete state tree of your application.
It allows you to dispatch actions, which trigger state changes.
The store is created by passing the root reducer function to the createStore function from Redux.
